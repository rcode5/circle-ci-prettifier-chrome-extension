prettify circle ci
=============

Don't you wish CircleCI encouraged you to get better with more positive messages than
`Failed!`.  Do you want your successes to be more full of praise like `You Rule!`?

Look no further.  Install this chrome extension and customize the messaging CircleCI
uses for both successful and failed builds.
